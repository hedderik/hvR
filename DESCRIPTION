Description: A set of utility functions used in the lab of Hedderik van Rijn. By combining all these functions in one package, students and other co-workers get easy access to all the non-standard functions our code might make use of. To provide a common framework, this package depends on a large number of other packages so that they get automatically loaded - although the code in this package does not require (all) these packages.
